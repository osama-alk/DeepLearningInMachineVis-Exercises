For this exercise, you are asked to create a Jupyter Notebook from scratch that tells a story about Fibonacci numbers.

Your notebook should at least contain the following contents:

    a short description of what Fibonacci numbers are, using Markdown;
    a working Python implementation that outputs the Fibonacci sequence of length n;
    a link to an external source that provides more information to the reader.

You are encouraged to further embellish your story as you see fit. Some ideas might include plots, math expressions, and external images.
